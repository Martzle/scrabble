# scrabble
I made scrabble in c++ for a school project.

Download both files and put dictionary.txt in the same folder as the executable. Do not change the file name.
This program uses the sowpods dictionary https://download.cnet.com/SOWPODS-Scrabble-Dictionary/3000-2279_4-10781736.html


This is still kind of buggy and I may patch it if I feel like it.

Inputting is also kind of scuffed so check out the rules in the game :)
