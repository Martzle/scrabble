# Scrabble
I made scrabble in c++ for a school project.

# How to play

Download both files and put dictionary.txt in the same folder as the executable. Do not change the file name.
This program uses the sowpods dictionary https://download.cnet.com/SOWPODS-Scrabble-Dictionary/3000-2279_4-10781736.html

# Notes

Inputs are a bit finnicky and a few minor errors exist so be careful when inputting.
Be sure to read the rules
